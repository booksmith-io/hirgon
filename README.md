# hirgon

Messenger of Gondor.

## DESCRIPTION

`hirgon` is a web application for scheduling message content.

Messages may be added, deleted, set active, or scheduled to be made active at a later date.

NOTE: this project is still WIP and missing several key features...

## INSTALLATION

### install system dependencies

- git
- npm
- nodejs
- sqlite3
- make

### install and setup the application

```
git clone git@github.com:booksmith-io/hirgon.git
cd hirgon
npm run setup
cp -a .hirgonrc.example .hirgonrc
```

### configuration

The configuration file contains the following keys and values:

#### `app`

The `app` section defines the application specific configuration.

```
"app": {
    "name": "hirgon",
    "port": 5000,
    "address": "0.0.0.0"
}
```

- `name` is required and controls the name of the running app
- `port` is required and is the port to bind the app to when running the application
- `address` is required and is the IP address to bind the app to when running the application

#### `session`

The `session` section defines the development and production session secret keys.

```
"session": {
    "secret": {
        "development": "keyboard-cat",
        "production": ""
    }
}
```

Both `development` and `production` are required for the environment the application is being run.

`production` is autogenerated when building the docker container.

#### `ratelimits`

The `ratelimits` section controls enabling and configuring ratelimiting per IP.

```
"ratelimits": {
    "enabled": 0,
    "requests_threshold": 7,
    "block_seconds": 300
}
```

- `enabled` is required and takes either 0 or 1 to disable or enable
- `requests_threshold` is required and takes a positive integer for how many requests per second before the IP is blocked
- `block_seconds` is required and takes a positive integer for how many seconds the IP is blocked after reaching the `requests_threshold`

#### `user_agent_blocks`

The `user_agent_blocks` section controls enabling and configuring user agents that shouldn't be allowed to access the app.

```
"user_agent_blocks": {
    "enabled": 0,
    "user_agents": [
        "facebookexternalhit",
        "facebookscraper",
        "openai",
        "OAI-SearchBot",
        "amazonbot",
        "Cortex-Xpanse"
    ]
}
```

- `enabled` is required takes either 0 or 1 to disable or enable
- `user_agents` is required and takes an array of user agent strings to match for blocking access
    - if a user agent in the list is making the request, a 406 (unacceptable) is returned
    - the user agent string is case insensitive and can be found anywhere in the user agent string making the request

### run the development server

```
npm run development
```

### update the application

```
npm run upgrade
npm run update_deps
npm run upgrade_database
```

### run through docker

```
# development - start in background (detached), uses host db/
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build

# development - restart to pick up code changes
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart

# development - view logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f

# production - code baked in, isolated db volume
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### run in production (not through docker)

#### add to systemd

```
cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/hirgon.service
[Service]
RuntimeDirectory=hirgon
ExecStart=/path/to/npx pm2-runtime start ecosystem.config.js
WorkingDirectory=/home/hirgon/git/hirgon/
Restart=always

StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=hirgon

Type=simple
User=hirgon
Group=hirgon

Environment=NODE_ENV=production

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

```
systemctl enable hirgon.service
systemctl start hirgon.service
```

#### add the proxy configuration to the webserver

##### apache2

within the appropriate vhost

```
ProxyPreserveHost on
ProxyPass / http://localhost:5000/
ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:5000/
```

##### nginx

within the appropriate vhost

```
location / {
    proxy_pass         http://localhost:5000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header   Host $host;
}
```

## TESTING

This repo has two github actions installed which help ensure quality of the project.

Both actions run on `push` and `pull_request` for the `main` branch.

### Test

The Test action runs two stages.  Both stages must pass for the PR to be merged.

#### lint

The `lint` stage verifies tidiness through `eslint`.

#### test

The `test` stage verifies the unit tests all pass.

### Docker Build Test

The Docker Build Test action verifies the docker image and containers build, explicitly using the `docker-compose` files to ensure they work as expected.

The test verifies several things:

- the server full starts
- the `/login` route returns without failure
- users can be created
- authentication with those users is successful
- expected content is found on `/`

The Docker Build Test action must pass for the PR to be merged.
